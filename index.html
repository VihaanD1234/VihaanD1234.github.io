    <h1 align="center">Healthy vs Unhealthy Relationships</h1>

    <p align="center">Everyone is in a relationship. Weather it's romantic, a sibling, a friend, or your parents. They are how people connect with each other. Not a single relationship is the same. It is like a spectrum, with healthy relationships at one end, and unhealthy relationships at the other. This website was made to bring awareness on unhealthy and abusive relationships, which can be damaging, and what to do if you are in one. </p>

  <span style="width: 30%; min-height: 150px;">Healthy relationships are the best possible relationship you can be in. It is important to build them because they build confidence and a sense of belonging. These relationships are enjoyable, like this <a href="clicker.html">Game</a> you can play. <div><img src="Happy.jpg" border="5" width="190" height="140" alt="Happy"  ></div></span>
  <span style="width: 30%; min-height: 150px;">Unhealthy relationships are very different from each other. One relationship can have only a little toxicity, and others can be life destroying. These relationships can cause major mental health issues and are usually caused by a power imbalance. If you are in one, consider communicating how you feel, but remember it's okay if you have to end the relationship if it is good for you. If you are the one causing the unhealthy relationship, consider how the other person feels and fix the changes that are needed.<div><img src="Caution.jpg" border="5" width="170" height="100" alt="Caution" ></div></span>
  <span style="width: 30%; min-height: 150px;">Abusive relationships are the most dangerous type of relationship. They can cause physical and mental harm. If you are in an abusive relationship, you need to get help immediately. Talk to a trusted adult, friend, or call a helpline like the <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/">Domestic Violence Hotline</a>. Remember, it is not your job to fix the abuser, especially if it means putting yourself at risk. <div><img src="Danger.jpg" border="5" width="170" height="170" alt="Danger" ></div></span>
